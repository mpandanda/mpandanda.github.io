Good day, my friend! You probably know who Farmer Dan is. Yeah, the guy with the bunnies who also offers the best milk for my icecream.

Since I'm pretty busy experimenting here with new flavors and I need to visit Lisa later, could you help me out with finding some of those bunnies?

Howdy, how's it been going for you recently? Is the egg hunt going well for you? I, personally, can say that an egg is a rare claim for some Pandas. I believe that it's because the brown chicken, which are not inside the barn, are losing feather. The white hens don't give a lot of eggs, though. Could you please get some eggs from the white chicken in my barn in order to get some eggs for the Pandas and find some feather that my brown chicken have lost?

Yay, you found them, you have a good eye Panda! I'm glad you learned a lesson with ol' Questy. It's really important to distinguish edible mushroom species from poisonous ones, as the last ones are toxic and are very dangerous for our bodies. However, that is no easy task! Some of them are really easy to differentiate, but others are very identical to the ones we can eat. You should always get advice from an experienced mushroom collector, as they know the guidelines to safely pick those delicious mushrooms!
